The objective of the project is to build a platform for exchanging, buying and selling used goods running on the web platform for users and managers. The focus of the platform is the exchange of old technology such as phones, computers, cameras, tablets, etc. This platform is a practical application in practice. Currently, there is no platform used exclusively for buying and selling old technology. There is only chotot.vn containing this feature. Refer to the oke.Xe application, a platform dedicated to the exchange of old cars, the project was formed to create the optimal platform for the exchange of old technology. The final result is not only the product as mentioned above, but also gives myself knowledge and skills such as: researching skills, programming and solving the problems.
